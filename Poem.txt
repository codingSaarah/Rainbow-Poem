Poem about Rainbow, Friendship & Life

Rainbows in a sky of blue 
with clouds of grey beyond,
Ripples lapping lilypads,
upon a golden pond,

All these things and more I dream
when sleep mine eyes doth close,
But most of all, a peace within, 
and love that always grows.

I don't think you will
Ever fully understand
How you've touched my life 
And made me who I am

I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldnâ€™t,
So I jumped in and sank.

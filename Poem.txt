Poem about Rainbow and Friendship 

Rainbows in a sky of blue 
with clouds of grey beyond,
Ripples lapping lilypads,
upon a golden pond,

Just above me and you
Blanketing our passion
As our loving ensues 
The sky watches us on 

A cool breeze on a summer's day,
my love within my arms,
Clouds that block the blazing sun, 
a coyish smile that charms,

All these things and more I dream
when sleep mine eyes doth close,
But most of all, a peace within, 
and love that always grows.

I don't think you will
Ever fully understand
How you've touched my life 
And made me who I am
